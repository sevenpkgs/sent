sent is a simple plaintext presentation tool.

This is my fork of suckless [sent](http://tools.suckless.org/sent), but with a gruvbox theme, a progress bar, and a keyboard shortcut to toggle between dark and light themes.

List of patches used:
1. [inverted colors](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches/inverted-colors/)
2. [progress bar](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches/progress-bar/)
3. [toggle scm](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/patches/toggle-scm/)  (Had to edit some of the patch manually, as it didn't work out of the box)
